        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups Arborio rice</li>
            <li>4 cups vegetable broth</li>
            <li>2 cups fresh spinach, chopped</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups sliced mushrooms (cremini or button)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, heat the vegetable broth over low heat, keeping it warm.</li>
            <li>In a large, deep skillet or saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until it becomes translucent, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1 minute, stirring to avoid burning.</li>
            <li>Stir in the Arborio rice, ensuring it is well-coated with the oil, onion, and garlic mixture. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the warm vegetable broth to the rice, one ladle at a time, stirring continuously. Allow each ladle of broth to be absorbed before adding the next one. This process should take about 20-25 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a separate skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they are tender and release their juices, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the rice has absorbed all the broth and reached a creamy consistency, stir in the cooked mushrooms and chopped spinach. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the spinach has wilted.</li>
            <li>Remove the risotto from the heat, and stir in the grated Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, garnished with additional Parmesan cheese, if desired. Enjoy your delicious creamy spinach and mushroom risotto!</li>
